            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <h5 class="info">The following amounts result in about 20 truffles</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can (395 g / 14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for rolling</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>Chocolate sprinkles, for coating</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="step"><strong>Cook the mixture</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">In a medium saucepan, combine the condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, scraping the bottom and sides to avoid burning.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Continue stirring until the mixture thickens and starts pulling away from the bottom of the pan (about 10–15 minutes).</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Cool</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Transfer the mixture to a greased plate or dish and let it cool to room temperature. You can also refrigerate it for 20–30 minutes to speed up the process.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Roll</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Grease your hands lightly with butter.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Scoop small portions of the mixture and roll into balls about the size of a cherry (2.5–3 cm / 1 inch).</li>
                    <li class="substep">Roll each ball in chocolate sprinkles until fully coated.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Serve</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Place the brigadeiros in small paper candy cups and serve at room temperature.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
