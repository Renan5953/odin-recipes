        <h3>About the dish:</h3>
        <p>Known in Brazil as <em>feijoada</em>, this traditional stew is made with black beans and a variety of pork cuts, including sausages and salted meats. Slow-cooked to develop rich, smoky flavors, feijoada is typically served with rice, collard greens, orange slices, and farofa. It is considered a national dish and is especially popular as a hearty weekend meal.</p>

                <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="step"><strong>Desalt the salted meats</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Soak the dried beef, ribs, pork foot, ear, and tail in cold water for 24 hours, changing the water several times (at least 3).</li>
                    <li class="substep">To speed up the process: boil each type of meat separately for 10–15 minutes and discard the water.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Cook the black beans</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Rinse the black beans and place them in a large pot with enough water to cover.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Add the bay leaves.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Simmer for about 1 hour (or 30 minutes in a pressure cooker), until tender but not falling apart. Set aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Cook the meats separately</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">In separate pots (or together if space allows), cook the desalted meats for about 30 to 40 minutes until tender.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Drain and set aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Sauté the seasoning</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">In a large pot (preferably the one you’ll use for the feijoada), heat the pork lard or oil.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Sauté the chopped onion until soft.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Add the garlic and sauté until lightly golden.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Combine everything</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Add the cooked beans (with their cooking liquid), the pre-cooked meats, and the sliced sausages into the pot with the seasoning.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Simmer everything together over low heat for about 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld and the broth to thicken slightly.</li>
                    <li class="substep">If necessary, add hot water occasionally to maintain the desired consistency.</li>
                    <li class="substep">Adjust salt (carefully, as the meats are already salty) and add black pepper to taste.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="step"><strong>Serve</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="substep">Serve hot with white rice, sautéed collard greens, toasted cassava flour (farofa), and orange slices to aid digestion.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
