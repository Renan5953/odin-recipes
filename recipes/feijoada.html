    <h3>About the dish:</h3>
    <p>Known in Brazil as <em>feijoada</em>, this traditional stew is made with black beans and a variety of pork cuts, including sausages and salted meats. Slow-cooked to develop rich, smoky flavors, feijoada is typically served with rice, collard greens, orange slices, and farofa. It is considered a national dish and is especially popular as a hearty weekend meal.</p>

    <h5>The following amounts result in 6 to 8 servings</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g (1.1 lb) black beans</li>
        <li>300 g (10.5 oz) dried beef (e.g., jerked beef), desalted</li>
        <li>300 g (10.5 oz) salted pork ribs, desalted</li>
        <li>1 pork foot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pork tail, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pork ear, chopped</li>
        <li>200 g (7 oz) smoked calabresa sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>150 g (5.3 oz) paio sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons of pork lard or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Desalt the salted meats</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Soak the dried beef, ribs, pork foot, ear, and tail in cold water for 24 hours, changing the water several times (at least 3).</li>
            <li>To speed up the process: boil each type of meat separately for 10–15 minutes and discard the water.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Cook the black beans</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the black beans and place them in a large pot with enough water to cover.</li>
            <li>Add the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Simmer for about 1 hour (or 30 minutes in a pressure cooker), until tender but not falling apart. Set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Cook the meats separately</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In separate pots (or together if space allows), cook the desalted meats for about 30 to 40 minutes until tender.</li>
            <li>Drain and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Sauté the seasoning</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large pot (preferably the one you’ll use for the feijoada), heat the pork lard or oil.</li>
            <li>Sauté the chopped onion until soft.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and sauté until lightly golden.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Combine everything</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the cooked beans (with their cooking liquid), the pre-cooked meats, and the sliced sausages into the pot with the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Simmer everything together over low heat for about 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld and the broth to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>If necessary, add hot water occasionally to maintain the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Adjust salt (carefully, as the meats are already salty) and add black pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve hot with white rice, sautéed collard greens, toasted cassava flour (farofa), and orange slices to aid digestion.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
